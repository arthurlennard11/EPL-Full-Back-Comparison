# 🕸️ Premier League Fullback Radar Comparison (2024/25)

---

## 🎯 Goal  
Create a visual comparison of Premier League fullbacks' 2024/25 seasons using radar (spider) graphs, in order to evaluate under-the-radar performances.

---

## 🤔 Hypothesis  
Leif Davis’s contributions during the 2024/25 Premier League season were comparable to — if not better than — many of the fullbacks widely praised in the media, despite receiving far less recognition.

---

## 📊 Data  
I selected several key performance metrics relevant to the modern fullback role (e.g., expected assists, shot creating actions, and interceptions). Then I gathered season statistics for Leif Davis and a handful of other top-performing fullbacks from FBRef.

---

## 🧠 Methods  
Using R, I cleaned and normalized the statistical data to ensure comparability across metrics. I then generated a series of radar plots (spider graphs) using `fmsb` and `ggplot` to visually highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each player relative to one another. This helped isolate patterns and elevate data-driven insights from the raw numbers.

## ✅ Outcome  
The radar plots strongly supported the hypothesis: Leif Davis’s performance metrics were on par with — and in some areas superior to — several fullbacks considered elite in 2024/25.

## 🧩 Takeaway  
Visualizing advanced stats can be a powerful method to challenge media narratives and surface hidden gems — especially in roles like fullback where contributions can be harder to quantify. Visuals like these can be especially valuable to scouts when trying to find hidden talents.
